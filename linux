DEVOPS: 13/03/2025
•	WHAT IS DEVOPS? Means to deliver the application speed into market we using devops
SDLC: software development lifecycle	
•	Why devops? means in software domain, we have 2 teams for developing the application 
1.	Development -plan, code, build, test
2.	Operations -deploy, operate, monitoring 
•	What is deployment? Means process of installing the application in the server 
•	Shortcut for SDLC life cycle

•	Devops is not a tool, technology or framework, devops is a methodology
DEVOPS LIFE CYCLE:
•	The logo of devops represents infinite because it’s a never-ending continuous process

IF WE BECOME DEVOPS ENG WHAT ARE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
•	Cloud/server/network/architecture     		used by AWS
•	Configuring & maintaining infrastructure 		used by terraform
•	CI/CD pipelines    					used by Jenkins
•	Automating daily tasks 				used by ansible and shell scripts
•	Continuous monitoring				used by 
•	Migrating form monolithic and microservices 	used by dockers and Kubernetes

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES: 14/03/2025
1.	ONE- TIER
2.	TWO-TIER
3.	THREE-TIER
4.	N-TIER
•	TIER MEANS ITS IS A SERVER OR LAYER 
•	Server: server means it serve the service to the end user
•	In real time mainly work on 3 services they are 
1.	Web server
2.	Application server
3.	Db server 
WEB SERVER:
•	It is also called as the presentation layer
•	Web server is used to see the front-end services to the end user, basically to show the application to the end user 
•	Who works: UI/UX developers 
•	What they are use means: web technologies 
•	Ex:  HTML, CSS, JS

APP SERVER:
•	It is also called as logical layer 
•	App server is used to use the application to end user 
•	Who work on it: backend developers
•	What they use means: programming languages
•	Ex: java, python, c, c++

DATABASE SERVER:
•	It is also called as db. Layer
•	Database server is used to store & retrieve the data 
•	Who work on it: db. admins 
•	What they used: db. Languages
•	Ex: SQL, oracle, postgree

ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE:
•	We use one- tier architecture what kind of application we develop means standalone applications.
•	The application will work on a local laptop.
•	All layers will be on locally.
•	It will not require any internet connection.
•	Ex: VLC MEDIA PLAYER 
TWO -TIER ARCHITECTURE
•	We use two -tier architecture what kind of application we develop means client server application
•	The application will work on a local laptop
•	Local: presentation layer, logical layer 		db.: internet 
•	It will be requiring internet connection 
•	Ex: banking application, jio Savan 
THREE TIER ARCHITECTURE
•	We use three-tier architecture what kind of application we develop means web applications (real time applications)
•	Application is no need to be in the local computers
•	Everything we can use from the internet
•	Ex: WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Flipkart.

AGENDA: 17/03/2025
Create a web server and show the live environment:
•	Server: A server provides various services to end users or client devices over a network. 
•	OS: operating system is used to communication b/w computer and user 
•	To create the server, we need to have cloud account 
•	We are using AWS cloud account 
•	AWS-server are called as EC2 instances-elastic compute cloud
•	To create EC2 instances we need to perform 7 steps.
1.	TAGS     -NAME 
2.	AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE)    -OS AND WE GET SOME SOFTWARE PACKAGES 
3.	INSTANCE _TYPE   			-CPU AND RAM
4.	KEY_PAIR	-LOGIN (PUBLIC-AWS, PRIVATE-USER) (public key is manage by, and private key is manage by user)
When we create keypair its store in our local laptop.

5.	NETWORK -VPC(VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD ),security groups(port number =0-65535)
6.	Storage -8gb -16tb 
7.	Summary -to review 
SSH-SECURE SHELL (22)-TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS 
AGENDA -18-03-2025
OS-TYPES 
OS -OS means to communicates with servers 
1.	WINDOWS
2.	LINUX
3.	MACOS
WHY TO USE LINUX:
•	Every electronics device all using Linux operating systems 
Advantages –
1.	Free and open sources 
2.	Security
3.	Performance is too good 
4.	Multiuser based 
5.	Multi-tasking 
MODES OF LINUX-TWO MODES:
1.	GUI 	: GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE -EX: CREATING THE FLIES IN LOCAL COMPUTER
2.	CLI	: COMMAND LINE INTERFACE -EX: COMUNITICATING WITH SEREVR WE ARE USING COMMANDS
COMMANDS:
1.	Sudo -I		: To switch from ec2-user to root users
2.	Sudo su -		: To switch from ec2-user to root user
3.	Sudo su		: To switch from ec2-user to root user
4.	Logout (ctrl d)	: To switch from root user to ec2- user
5.	Cat 			: display the content from files 
6.	Cat /proc/CPUinfo	:to show the CPU information
7.	Lscpu			: to show the CPU information
8.	Cat /proc/meminfo	: to show the memory information      		this is RAM INFORMATION command 
9.	Lsmem		: to show the memory information     		  this is RAM INFORMATION command 
10.	Fdisk -l		:to show the ROM or volume information
11.	Lsblk			: to show the ROM or volume information   	LSBLKMEANS LIST THE BLOCK DEVICES 
12.	Hostname -I		:to show the Ip address   else we can use this command alsoipconfig  ip addr ip addr show   
13.	Clear or ctrl L	:to clear the screen 

FILE COMMANSD:
1.	TOUCH FILENAME			:to create a file 
2.	LS/LL					:to show list of files
3.	CAT FILENAME 			:to show the content of filesMORE command also we use to show the content
4.	CAT>>FILENAME 			:to insert the content in file      static method
5.	ENTER AND CTRL D			:to save content and exit 
6.	CP FILE1 FILE2			: copies the content from file1 to file2 here no need to create file2 before copy  directly Linux will create the file ,actually Linux will create files automatically while giving file name 
7.	Cat file1>> file2			: if we copied from file1 to file2, file2 content will gone ,that’s why  this command will use to not erase or without override  content form the file 2
8.	MV FILE1 FILE2			: rename the file name 
9.	RM FILE1				: To remove the file 
10.	RM FILE1 -F				: To remove the file FORCEFULLY WITH OUT ASKING 
11.	RM * -F				: To remove the ALL file FORCEFULLY
12.	TOUCH file {1..100}			:to create 100 files at a time
13.	Head file1				: by default, it shows the content of first 10 lines 
14.	Head -5 file1				:it shows the content of first 5 lines 
15.	Tail file1				: by default, it shows the content of first 10 lines
16.	Tail -20 file1				: it shows the content of first 20 lines
17.	SED -N ‘5,15P’ FILE1			:to show middle line content 5th line to 15th line                                                                              						SED MEANS -STREAM EDITOR 														-N NUMBER  P MEANS -PRINT 
6th session

24.	: %s/word1/new word/	: to replace word1 with new word  in side the file 
25.	: %s/word1/new word/g	: to replace word1 with new wordif we have repeated words in the same line 
Permissions:
-rw-r- - r-- in Linux we have to give permissions to  file ,why to give permissions means whenever  we  execute scripts some permissions is required
3 types of permissions:
1.	(-)		: regular files
2.	(b)	 	: blocked files 
3.	(c) 	 	: character file
4.	(d)		: directory
5.	 (l)		: link file
Permissions:
•	Read		: r	:4
•	Write		: w	:2
•	Executable 	: x	:1
Categories:
•	User	: rw-		:6
•	Group	: r--		:4
•	Others: r--		:4
•	Ch mod  we give permissions to users 
•	Other method is chmod u=rw,g=rx,o=wx file1
•	

GREP command:
•	GREPglobal regular expression print
•	Grep command is used to search a words in the file
1.	Grep word1 file1				:to search for a word  it is case sensitive
2.	Grep word1 file1 -i				:to search for word to avoid case sensitive we are using -i
3.	Grep word1 file1 -ic				: how many time the word is repeating
4.	Grep word1 file1 -v 				:to print lines without word given in command	
5.	Grep ‘word1\| word2\| word 3 file1		:to search multiple words
6.	Cat file1 | grep word1 			: ‘|’: it is the pipe symbol: here 1st command is the input for second command. 
SED command:
•	To used to replace the words in the file 
1.	Sed ‘s/word1/new word/’ file1			:to replace the word with new word but really it not change 
2.	Sed ‘s/word1/new word/’ file1 >> file2		: it will change in the file2 but not in the file 1
3.	Sed ‘s/word1/new word; s/word/new word/’ file1 	:to replace the multiple words
4.	Sed ‘2c  words’ file1					:to replace a line with other line 
5.	Sed -n file 						: to print the number lines 
6.	Sed -n ‘5,12p’ file1 					:to print the line from 5 to 12
7.	Cat -n file1  | sed -n ‘5,12p’
8.	Sed -n ‘10p’ file1					: to print specific line only
